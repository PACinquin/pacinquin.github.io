	<p>For this one I wanted to focus on the graphic part, and thus engage in Pixel Art. It was quite fun and satisfying. Working collaboratively with Anna who had a degree in art was also really positive as we could learn different things from each other.</p>
	<p>The game received a important amount of good feedback, and ranked in <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/bloedbad">top 5-20% depending on the category</a>.</p>
