	<h1>Rogue Mansion</h1>
	<p>After playing a Metroid inspired Rogue Like called "A Robot Named Fight", I had this idea of doing the same for one of my favorite game when I was a teenager, Resident Evil. Based on that I developed a procedural system to create a Mansion where rooms, keys, enemies and items would be randomized. At this point I have a functional first floor, with locked door and keys to open them than you need to find along a golden path to ensure you cannot be softlocked. Everything is pretty rough for now but I also added some PSX style textures to give more diversity.
<p> Engine Used : Unity.</p>
