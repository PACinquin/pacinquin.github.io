	<h1>Me1ro</h1>
	<p>This game was made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019/">GMTK Game Jam 2019</a> under the theme "only one".</p>
	<p>Team: Pierre-Antoine Cinquin (Level Design, Music), Thibault Laine (Game Design, Implementation, Optimization), Erwan Normand (Implementation, Optimization), Joan Sol Roo (Game Design, Art, Implementation) and Damien Clergeaud (Project Lead, Game Design, Level Design, Implementation).</p>
	<p>You can play the game <a href="https://saltadrow.itch.io/me1ro">HERE</a>.</p>

	<p>The process was quite messy, and probably too much "tech-oriented" but we managed to design some interesting part that might be used for other projects (aka, crowd control engine). At least, it serves as a way to think about how future jam might be handled.</p>
