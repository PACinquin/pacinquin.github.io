	<h1>Stompy vs The Monolith</h1>
	<p>This game was made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-102">Weekly Game Jam 102</a> in June 2019. The theme was "One Big Boss". It is made as an asymmetrical game, where one side plays a city builder/strategy game trying to stay safe (MONOLITH), while the other side plays a Beat'em up trying to destroy the city and eat its citizens (STOMPY).</p>
	<p>Team: Pierre-Antoine Cinquin (Monster Animations, Sound, Testing) and Joan Sol Roo (Game Design, Art, Visuals).</p>
	<p>You can play the game <a href="https://solroo.itch.io/stompy-vs-monolith">HERE</a>.</p>

	<p>This one started more as a "toy" around launching missile in a Godzilla rip-off scene, but discussions led us to try on assymetrical game mechanics. The game is still really unpolished, but I really like the graphical aspect, and the two players - Mouse VS Keyboard - way of interact with it.</p>
