	<h1>Voiid Cube</h1>
	<p>This game was made for the Ludum Dare 46 (April 2020). This is a puzzle platformer where you need to keep an ancient artifact alive and bring it to the end of the Dungeon. The art style tries to mimick the first Playstation games, with the use of shaders to emulate the limitations of the console. This is the first game jam I did alone!</p>
	<p>Team: Pierre-Antoine Cinquin (Game Design, Code, Art).</p>
	<p>You can play the game <a href="https://saltadrow.itch.io/voiid-cube">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>A larger version named Voiid Dungeon is in a prototype state, you can see a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_uSYvTfNRs">HERE</a></p>
