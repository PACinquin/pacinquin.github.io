	<h1>Cattuccino</h1>
	<p>This game was made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/coffee-jam">Coffe Jam 18</a> (21/07/2018 to 28/07/2018). You play as an alien cat stucked in a coffee machine, trying to serve the beverages ordered. Spoiler: it's nearly impossible and will undoubtedly end in a big mess.</p>
	<p>Team: Pierre-Antoine Cinquin (Game Design, Sound, Music), Leo Cousin (Art) and Joan Sol Roo (Game Design, Implementation).</p>
	<p>You can play the game <a href="https://solroo.itch.io/cattuccino-express">HERE</a>.</p>

	<p>As a lot of time, we started with a totally different idea and changed direction mid-jam. Thus, it is more a new-retro experience than a game.</p>
