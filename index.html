<h1>Hi there, I'm Pierre-Antoine!!</h1>
<p><img class="avatar" src="/img/pac.png" alt="This is a drawing of me.">
I'm actually a User Research Analyst at Ubisoft Bordeaux. My role is to support teams in following an insights-based approach by conducting user tests. This involves defining test objectives and choosing appropriate procedures and tools to address them, identifying participants recruitment criteria, planning test schedules, analyzing qualitative and quantitative data from various sources, providing actionable information to game development teams, and clearly communicating test results to stakeholders.</p>

<p>Before that I did a PhD in Cognitive Sciences at the University of Bordeaux (EA4136 LAB - HACS - Bordeaux Population Health, Inserm, Bordeaux) along the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/potioc/">Potioc research team</a> (Inria, University of Bordeaux, CNRS). My area of research was on e-learning accessibility, with a focus on co-design and evaluation methods of user interfaces and tools to support the learning activities of people with cognitive impairments. I am also a consulting manager within the non-profit organization CapGame, which aims to provide guidance and training to video game professionals about game accessibility.</p>

<p>I'm also making video games in my spare time and you can check all the ones I was involved in the making in the <a href="/playthings.html">Games</a> section.</p>
