	<h1>Hi there, I'm Pierre-Antoine!</h1>
	<p>I'm a third year PhD student in Cognitive Sciences at the University of Bordeaux (EA4136 LAB - HACS - Bordeaux Population Health, Inserm, Bordeaux) and a member of the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/potioc/">Potioc research team</a> (Inria, University of Bordeaux, CNRS). My current area of research focuses on e-learning accessibility, with a focus on co-design and evaluation methods of user interfaces and tools to support the learning activities of people with cognitive impairments. I am also consulting manager within the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.capgame.fr/">CapGame</a>, which aims to provide guidance and training to video game professionals about game accessibility.</p>
