	<h1>PhD Summary (Work in progress)</h1>
	<p>The representation of people with disabilities decreases sharply throughout the school system, resulting in lower levels of qualification, further hindering employment opportunities and reinforcing their exclusion from the social sphere. Moreover, this observation is aggravated when the disability situation involves cognitive impairments. The significant evolution of online training, as demonstrated by the massive growth of MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) platforms, could provide a real opportunity to meet the training needs of persons with disabilities. Unfortunately, like many digital devices, these systems suffer from a lack of accessibility.</p>

	<p>Based on a state of the art on the accessibility of digital education systems, we have initiated a co-design process involving students with cognitive disabilities (N=6) and professionals in the field of cognitive disability and accessibility (N=13). This work has resulted in the development of a framework for the design of accessible e-learning systems based on the various needs and guidelines that have emerged during the process. It was followed by the development and implementation of a first prototype of an accessible MOOC player called Aïana, which was the subject of a pilot evaluation. A two years field study was carried out in order to evaluate Aïana's effectiveness on learning performance, induced cognitive load, self-determination, usability and efficiency, with a large sample of participants (N=1087 including 150 persons with disabilities) from a MOOC broadcast on the national FUN platform. The first results confirm its good usability and its positive impact on learning as well as its positive impact on the self-determination of persons with disabilities, particularly those with cognitive impairments, thus reinforcing the relevance of our design principles. All the results of the field study are currently being processed.</p>
